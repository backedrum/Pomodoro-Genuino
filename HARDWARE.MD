This version of hardware uses Spaceship Interface project hardware setup from https://www.arduino.cc/en/ArduinoStarterKit/Prj02
Please follow the instructions from this kit. The only change you need to do is to replace second red LED with a yellow one 
in order to form a traffic light like LEDs structure.
